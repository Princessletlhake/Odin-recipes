# 🍽️ Odin Recipes Website

Welcome to my **HTML Recipe Website**!  
This is a basic website built using pure HTML. It displays some of my favorite recipes in a clean and simple layout.

## 🧠 Why I Built This Website

I created this project as part of my learning journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
The goal was to:

- Get comfortable with writing pure HTML
- Understand how to create and organize multiple web pages
- Practice linking pages together using relative paths
- Learn how to structure content for readability and accessibility

It’s also a fun way to combine my love for cooking with my interest in web development!
